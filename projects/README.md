# Projects

These are my projects I developed in the UPV EHU (Universidad del Pais Vasco Euskal Herriko Unibersitatea) in the subject *Machine learning and neural networks* [https://tinyurl.com/y6vk4fg4] in my exchange program, from Mexico to Spain, the basque country, San Sebastian. Each project has its python notebook and its report. In some projects, I was helped with the report by people from Colombia and Germany.

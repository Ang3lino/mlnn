# Projects

These are my projects I developed in the UPV EHU (Universidad del Pais Vasco Euskal Herriko Unibersitatea) in the subject *Machine learning and neural networks* in my exchange program, from Mexico to Spain, the basque country, San Sebastian. In some projects, I was helped with the report by people from Colombia and Germany.

The first partial corresponds to machine learning, the second one to neural networks and the final to deep learning.

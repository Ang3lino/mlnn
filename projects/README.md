# Projects

These are my projects I developed in the UPV EHU (Universidad del Pais Vasco Euskal Herriko Unibersitatea) in the subject *Machine learning and neural networks* in my exchange program, from Mexico to Spain, the basque country, San Sebastian. Each project has its python notebook and one report. In some projects, I was helped with the report by people from Colombia and Germany.

The course was structured as follows

| Partial | Topic |
| ------ | ------ |
| 1 | Machine learning |
| 2 | Neural networks |
| 3 | Deep learning |

Many other things were reviewed as a high level.




| Topic | Project name |
| ------ | ------ |
| Machine learning | Electroencephalogram binary classification |
| Machine learning | Shape classification |
| Neural networks | Face gender classification |
| Deep learning | Text classification using recurrent neural networks |
| Deep learning | Crafting adversarial examples |

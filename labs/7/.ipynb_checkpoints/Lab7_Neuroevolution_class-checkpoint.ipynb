    "\n",
    "A multiplexer is a device that allows two or more digital input signals to be selected. The multiplexer problem has been extensively used in AI. We can represent a multipler as a function defined on a vector or n+2^n bits. The function uses the first n bits to decode which of the following 2^n bits should be given as output.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a multipler of n=2 has 2+2^2=6 bits. The multiplexer function would works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "f([0,1,1,0,1,1]) = 0.  The first two bits are used to decode the index, ind=2*0+1=1. The value of the variable in the position ind+2 is the output. In this example v[3]=0\n",

    "f([1,1,1,1,1,0]) = 0.\n",

    "1. Use NEAT to evolve a neural network that computes the multiplexer function for n=2.\n",
    "2. After running the function modify the number of hidden units in the configuration file\n",
    "2. Make it a fitness minimization problem (you will have to change the config file, and have another approach in the evaluation function)\n",
    "3. Visualize the network\n",
